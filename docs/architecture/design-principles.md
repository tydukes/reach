# Design Principles

These principles guide every decision in REACH development.

## 1. Accessibility is Not Optional

Every feature must be accessible from day one. Accessibility is not an afterthoughtâ€”it's the core purpose of REACH.

### Requirements

- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works for all features
- Verify WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- Test with high contrast mode
- Consider users with motor, visual, auditory, and cognitive disabilities

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
// Semantic HTML with ARIA labels
<button aria-label="Start voice recording" onClick={startRecording}>
  ðŸŽ¤ Record
</button>
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Missing accessibility attributes
<div onClick={startRecording}>ðŸŽ¤</div>
```

## 2. Privacy by Design

User data must be protected at every layer. Privacy is not configurableâ€”it's mandatory.

### Requirements

- **Local-first**: Process data locally when possible
- **Encrypted storage**: All user data encrypted at rest
- **Minimal telemetry**: Only collect essential, anonymized metrics with user consent
- **No cloud dependency**: Core functionality works offline

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
// Encrypt before storing
const encrypted = await encrypt(userData, userKey);
await storage.save(encrypted);
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Storing sensitive data in plain text
await storage.save(userData);
```

## 3. Autonomous Agents Minimize User Effort

AI agents should handle complexity, not burden users with it.

### Requirements

- Understand context from conversation history
- Complete multi-step tasks independently
- Learn from user patterns
- Ask for clarification only when necessary

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
// Agent understands context
user: "Send that to John"
agent: // Knows "that" refers to previous file discussed
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Requires explicit re-specification
user: "Send that to John"
agent: "What would you like to send?"
```

## 4. Natural Interaction Over Commands

Users speak naturally, not in command syntax.

### Requirements

- Support conversational language
- Handle ambiguity gracefully
- Don't require memorized commands
- Provide contextual suggestions

### Examples

**Good**:

```
User: "Can you help me write an email to Sarah about the meeting?"
Agent: "I'll draft an email to Sarah regarding your meeting. What would you like to say?"
```

**Bad**:

```
User: "email sarah meeting"
Agent: "Invalid command. Use: email --to sarah --subject meeting"
```

## 5. Progressive Enhancement

Features should work at a baseline level and improve based on available resources.

### Requirements

- Core functionality works without advanced features
- Graceful degradation when resources unavailable
- Optional cloud features don't break local-only mode
- Plugins enhance but don't replace core features

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
// Falls back to basic TTS if advanced engine unavailable
const tts = await loadAdvancedTTS() || loadBasicTTS();
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Crashes if advanced TTS unavailable
const tts = await loadAdvancedTTS();
tts.speak(text); // Throws if tts is null
```

## 6. Extensible by the Community

The architecture must support community contributions safely.

### Requirements

- Well-documented plugin API
- Security boundaries between core and plugins
- Version compatibility guarantees
- Clear deprecation policies

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
// Plugin API with versioning
export interface ReachPlugin {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  compatibleWith: string; // "^0.1.0"
  initialize(): Promise<void>;
}
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Plugins access private internals
export class MyPlugin {
  // Directly modifies core state
  modifyCoreInternals(core: any) { ... }
}
```

## 7. Test with Assistive Technologies

Every change must be verified with real assistive technology tools.

### Requirements

- Run screen reader tests
- Test with keyboard-only navigation
- Verify with voice control software
- Check with high contrast themes

### Tools

- **NVDA** (Windows, free)
- **JAWS** (Windows, commercial)
- **VoiceOver** (macOS, built-in)
- **Orca** (Linux, free)

## 8. Document Everything

Code is written for humans first, machines second.

### Requirements

- Clear, concise comments
- Up-to-date README files
- API documentation with examples
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for major choices

### Examples

**Good**:

```typescript
/**
 * Encrypts user data using AES-256-GCM.
 *
 * @param data - Plain text data to encrypt
 * @param key - 256-bit encryption key
 * @returns Encrypted data with IV prepended
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const encrypted = await encrypt(userData, userKey);
 * ```
 */
export async function encrypt(data: string, key: CryptoKey): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
```

**Bad**:

```typescript
// Encrypts stuff
export async function encrypt(data: string, key: CryptoKey): Promise<ArrayBuffer>
```
