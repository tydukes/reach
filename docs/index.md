An AI-powered accessibility framework that empowers users with disabilities to interact with their computers through natural conversation. Voice-first, privacy-focused, and autonomous.

## 🎯 Mission

To create a truly accessible computing environment where anyone, regardless of physical ability, can accomplish any task through natural conversation with AI agents that understand, learn, and act autonomously on their behalf.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 **Voice-First Interface**: Natural conversation replaces keyboard input
- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Agents**: Handle complex tasks with minimal user input
- 🧠 **Adaptive Learning**: System learns user patterns and anticipates needs
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Local processing with encrypted data storage
- 🔧 **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for community contributions
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Built from the ground up for users with disabilities

## 🚧 Status

REACH is currently in active development. We're working toward our MVP release (v0.1.0).

## 🔒 Security

Security is a top priority for REACH. We employ multiple layers of automated security scanning:

- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis on every commit
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **npm audit**: Vulnerability scanning in CI
- **Socket.dev/Snyk**: Supply chain security monitoring

See [Security Policy](contributing/security.md) for our security policy and vulnerability reporting process.
