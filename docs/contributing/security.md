## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please email security reports to the maintainers. You should receive a response within 48 hours.

## Security Measures

REACH employs multiple layers of automated security scanning:

- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis on every commit
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **npm audit**: Vulnerability scanning in CI
- **Socket.dev/Snyk**: Supply chain security monitoring

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure practices and will work with security researchers to address reported vulnerabilities responsibly.
