# Contributing to REACH

Thank you for your interest in contributing to REACH! We welcome contributions from everyone, especially those with lived experience with disabilities.

## üéØ Our Mission

REACH aims to make computing accessible to everyone through AI-powered voice interfaces. Accessibility is not a feature‚Äîit's our core principle.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Find an issue**: Check our [issues](https://github.com/tydukes/reach/issues) or [project board](https://github.com/tydukes/reach/projects/1)
2. **Comment on it**: Let us know you're working on it
3. **Fork the repo**: Click "Fork" button (if external contributor)
4. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/issue-NUMBER-description`
5. **Make changes**: Write code, tests, and docs
6. **Submit PR**: Push and create a Pull Request

## üìã Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop**: Required for dev container environment
- **Visual Studio Code**: With Remote - Containers extension
- **Git**: Version control

### Option 1: Dev Container (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the VSCode dev container, which provides a consistent development environment with all dependencies pre-installed.

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Open in Dev Container**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tydukes/reach.git
   cd reach
   code .
   ```

   - VSCode will detect the `.devcontainer` configuration
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - Wait for the container to build and start (first time takes 5-10 minutes)
   - Dependencies will be automatically installed via `npm install`

3. **Verify Setup**:

   ```bash
   node --version    # Should be 20.x or higher
   npm --version     # Should be 10.x or higher
   python3 --version # Should be 3.11.x or higher
   npm test          # Run tests
   ```

**What's Included in the Dev Container:**

- Node.js 20+ with npm
- Python 3.11+ for future ML tools
- Audio libraries (ALSA, PortAudio, FFmpeg) for voice processing
- Git, Zsh with Oh My Zsh
- VSCode extensions: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, GitLens, and more
- Pre-configured linting and formatting

### Option 2: Local Setup

If you prefer to develop locally without Docker:

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Node.js 20+ from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Python 3.11+ from [python.org](https://python.org/)
   - Audio libraries for your OS:
     - **Linux**: `sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libportaudio2 portaudio19-dev libsndfile1-dev ffmpeg`
     - **macOS**: `brew install portaudio libsndfile ffmpeg`
     - **Windows**: Install via vcpkg or chocolatey

2. **Clone and Install**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tydukes/reach.git
   cd reach
   npm install
   npm test
   ```

## ‚úÖ Pull Request Guidelines

- **Reference the issue**: Include "Closes #123" in PR description
- **Write tests**: All new code should have tests
- **Update docs**: If you change behavior, update documentation
- **Follow conventions**: Run `npm run lint` before committing
- **Keep it focused**: One PR per feature/fix

## üß™ Testing

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Coverage report
```

## üìù Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:

- `feat: add voice input support`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in session manager`
- `docs: update installation guide`
- `test: add tests for guardrails`

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

**AI-assisted development is encouraged and embraced** on this project, especially given our accessibility focus. AI tools can help make development more accessible and productive.

### Best Practices

- **Always review AI-generated code**: Understand what the code does before committing
- **Test thoroughly**: Run tests and verify functionality works as expected
- **Check for accessibility**: Ensure AI suggestions maintain accessibility standards
- **Verify security**: Review for potential security issues or exposed credentials
- **Maintain code quality**: Ensure generated code follows project conventions and standards
- **Ask questions**: If you don't understand AI-generated code, ask for clarification or refactor it

### Using AI Tools

- **Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor**: All are great tools for this project
- **Context**: Share relevant files and project documentation with AI assistants
- **Iterative**: Work iteratively, reviewing and testing at each step
- **Human oversight**: You are responsible for all code committed, regardless of who/what wrote it

### Why We Encourage AI

- Makes coding more accessible to developers with disabilities
- Speeds up development while maintaining quality
- Helps with documentation and test generation
- Assists with accessibility best practices
- Reduces cognitive load for complex tasks

**Remember**: AI is a powerful tool, but human judgment, creativity, and oversight are irreplaceable.

## ‚ôø Accessibility First

When contributing UI changes:

- Test with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Verify WCAG 2.1 AAA compliance
- Test with high contrast mode
